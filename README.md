# Bank Management System


Overview:

This C++ project implements a basic bank management system that allows users to register, login, and manage their bank accounts. It includes features for user authentication, account blocking/unblocking, and balance management. The system uses SHA-256 encryption for password security.

## The classes included in this project are:



- User: The base class for all users

- Customer: The customer class that inherits from the User class

- Employee: The employee class that inherits from the User class
 
- EmployeeCustomer: The employee-customer class that inherits from both the Customer and Employee classes

- Admin: The administrator class that inherits from the User class
